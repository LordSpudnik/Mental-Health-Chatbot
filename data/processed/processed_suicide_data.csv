"2,""Ex Wife Threatening SuicideRecently I left my wife for good because she has cheated on me twice and lied to me so much that I have decided to refuse to go back to her. As of a few days ago, she began threatening suicide. I have tirelessly spent these paat few days talking her out of it and she keeps hesitating because she wants to believe I'll come back. I know a lot of people will threaten this in order to get their way, but what happens if she really does? What do I do and how am I supposed to handle her death on my hands? I still love my wife but I cannot deal with getting cheated on again and constantly feeling insecure. I'm worried today may be the day she does it and I hope so much it doesn't happen.""",suicide,ex wife threatening suiciderecently left wife good cheated twice lied much decided refuse go back day ago began threatening suicide tirelessly spent paat day talking keep hesitating want believe come back know lot people threaten order get way happens really supposed handle death hand still love wife cannot deal getting cheated constantly feeling insecure worried today may day hope much happen

"9,""IÃ¢â¬â¢m so lostHello, my name is Adam (16) and IÃ¢â¬â¢ve been struggling for years and IÃ¢â¬â¢m afraid. Through these past years thoughts of suicide, fear, anxiety IÃ¢â¬â¢m so close to my limit . IÃ¢â¬â¢ve been quiet for so long and IÃ¢â¬â¢m too scared to come out to my family about these feelings. About 3 years ago  losing my aunt triggered it all. Everyday feeling hopeless , lost, guilty, and remorseful over her and all the things IÃ¢â¬â¢ve done in my life,but thoughts like these with the little IÃ¢â¬â¢ve experienced in life? Only time IÃ¢â¬â¢ve revealed these feelings to my family is when I broke down where they saw my cuts. Watching them get so worried over something I portrayed as an average day made me feel absolutely dreadful. They later found out I was an attempt survivor from attempt OD(overdose from pills) and attempt hanging.

"18,""My life is over at 20 years oldHello all. I am a 20 year old balding male. My hairline is trash and to make matters worse my head is HUGE.

I pop Xanax all day to try and numb the pain and it works for a little bit but it all comes crashing back twice as hard once I come down.

The only reason I havenÃ¢â¬â¢t killed myself yet is because of my mom and brothers. If I didnÃ¢â¬â¢t have them IÃ¢â¬â¢d be dead long ago. But itÃ¢â¬â¢s getting to the point where even their love and support isnÃ¢â¬â¢t going to be enough to keep me alive anymore.
